		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a young woman springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.</p>
			<p class="flavor">Taking a deep breath, a man covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.</p>
			<p class="flavor">Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad woman steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its clothwrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.</p>
			<p>Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p>      
			<h4>ESSENCE</h4>
			<p>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call essence. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the world—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of essence in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of essence gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p>
			<h4>TRAINING AND ASCETICISM</h4>
			<p>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.</p>
			<p class="indent">The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.</p>
			<p class="indent">For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.</p>      
			<h4>CREATING A MONK</h4>
			<p>As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?</p>
			<p class="indent">Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?</p>
			<p class="indent">As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness essence, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the hermit background.</p>

			<p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. Each discipline grants you access to a spell that requires you to spend essence points each time you cast it.</p>
			<p class="indent">You know the Elementalism discipline and two other elemental disciplines of your choice, which are detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Casting Elemental Spells.</em></strong> Each elemental discipline gives you access to a spell. To cast one of these spells, you spend essence points equal to its level. The spell is then cast following all the normal rules for spellcasting (see chapter 10). Certain spells can be cast at a higher level to enhance their effects, as stated in their description. To do so, spend essence points equal to the desired level of the spell, rather than its actual level. The maximum number of essence points you can spend on a single spellcasting is equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>For example, it would normally cost 1 essence point to cast <i>Sweeping Cinder Strike</i> (a 1st-level spell). However, you could instead spend 2 essence points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell, increasing its damage by one die (as stated in the spell's description). For a third-level character with a profiency bonus of +2, this is the highest level at which the spell can be cast.</i></p> 
			<p class="indent">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your elemental discipline spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a discipline spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
		</description>
		<sheet usage="Essence">
			<description>You learn elemental disciplines that grant you access to spells.</description>
			<description>You can cast an elemental discipline spell by spending essence points equal to its level (0 for cantrips).

			<p>You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 + 2d4 damage. Choose one of the d6s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
				<tr><td>D6</td><td>Damage Type</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>Thunder</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>Cold</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>Poison</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>Lightning</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>Fire</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>Acid</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p class="indent">If you roll the same number on any of the d6s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell. Note that you <em>must</em> pick a new target when the spell leaps, if possible. This means you might be forced to pick a less desirable target (such as an ally!).</p>
			<p class="indent">For this spell, only the 2d4 dice scale with your Martial Arts dice. While your Martial Arts dice are also d6s, use two pair of different colored dice to keep them apart.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d4 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.</p>

		  <p>You leap into the air and land between your enemies in an explosion of flames. As part of the action to cast this spell, you can jump up to 30 feet horizontally or 15 feet vertically. This jump does not cost any of your movement and does not provoke opportunity attacks. It can extend a jump that was started before the casting of this spell. When you land, a wave of fire sweeps out from you in all directions. Each creature within a 20-foot radius of you, other than yourself, must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature suffers 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a succesful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.</p>		  
		  <p class="indent">You cannot cast this spell if you are restrained, grappled, or your movement speed is reduced to 0 for any other reason.</p>
		  <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

		  <p>As you trace intricate gestures through the air, mist rises around you until finally you disappear in the mist yourself. You transform into a misty cloud for the duration of the spell, along with everything you're wearing and carrying. The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points. While in this form, your only method of movement is a flying speed equal to your unarmored movement bonus. You can enter and occupy the space of another creature. You have resistance to nonmagical damage, and you have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. You can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though you treat liquids as though they were solid surfaces. You can’t fall and remain hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated. While in the form of a misty cloud, you can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects you were carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. You can’t attack or cast spells.</p>

Creatures that fail to or are unable to do so still take half of the 5d8 fire damage. Creatures that fail to jump the required 10 feet end up in the river and take full damage.</p>
