	<element name="Chaotic Good (Liberator)" type="Alignment" source="Player’s Handbook" id="ID_ALIGNMENT_CHAOTIC_GOOD">
		<supports>Standard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for the wishes of society. He makes his own way, but he’s kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness of the individual, but has little faith in laws and institutions. He hates it when people impose their will on others and tell them what to do.</p>
			<p>Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a good heart with a free spirit.</p>
