		<description>
			<p>A lawful good character acts as a good person is required to act. She combines a selfless commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. She tells the truth, keeps her word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished.</p>
			<p>Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it combines honor and compassion.</p>
