    <description>
      <p class="flavor">Although they lost much in the Fall, humans remain the dominant race on Tal Ahmur. Whether they seek to survive in the ruins of their once-great kingdom of Caladon, the savage frontier of the Verge, or the decadent city states of the Nightlands, humans refuse to let their time be past.</p>
      <h4>HUMAN TRAITS</h4>

        <span class="feature">Alignment.</span>Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.<br />
        <span class="feature">Size.</span>Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.<br />
        <span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br />
        <span class="feature">Languages.</span>You can speak, read, and write Common.<br />

    <description>
      <p>You consider yourself of mixed or indeterminate heritage. While this could mean your parents were of two different ethnic backgrounds, it could also reflect an upbringing that wasn't strongly influenced by any one culture for other reasons. Maybe you were raised in a cosmopolitan city, or moved around frequently during your formative years. Maybe you didn't care for or actively rebelled against local cultural norms. Whatever the reason, it has made you highly adaptable and versatile.</p>
